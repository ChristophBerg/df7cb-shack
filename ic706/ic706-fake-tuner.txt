The (+) side of C is connected to the 13.8VDC pin. The (-) side connected to
TSTR and TKEY which are connected together. Resistor R is in parallel with C.
Below is a diagram of the AH4 connector on the back of the IC706 where the <
indicates the pointy end of the connector (Pin 1 = TKEY).

The values I use are C=1000uF 16WV R=92K Ohms 1/8 Watt which result in 15
seconds of tune time. As you can see, these are tied in parallel. If you want
to use a physically smaller capacitor such as 440 uF, you can adjust the time
by raising R.

C = 470µF
R = 180kΩ
